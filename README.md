# Fraud Detection Project
Welcome to the Fraud Detection project repository! This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities using machine learning techniques applied to open data from Kaggle. Below, you'll find an overview of the project components and how to navigate through the repository.

## Overview

Fraudulent activities pose significant threats across various industries, from financial institutions to e-commerce platforms. This project aims to mitigate these risks by leveraging data analysis and machine learning algorithms to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions effectively.

## Data Analysis Processes

In this project, thorough data analysis processes have been implemented to gain insights into the underlying patterns of fraudulent activities. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques have been employed to understand the characteristics and distributions of the dataset features. Additionally, feature engineering methods have been applied to enhance the predictive power of the machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models have been developed and evaluated to accurately classify fraudulent transactions, such as:
- LGBM
- XGBoost
- Random Forest
The models are trained on labeled data and optimized to achieve high precision and recall rates in detecting fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives.

## Dashboard

A user-friendly dashboard has been created to visualize the results of the fraud detection models. The dashboard, located in the 'docs' folder, provides interactive visualizations and insights derived from the analysis. It offers a convenient interface for stakeholders to monitor and analyze potential fraudulent transactions efficiently.
